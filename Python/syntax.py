# Execute Python Syntax
# Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:

# >>> print("Hello, World!")
# Hello, World!
# Python Indentation
# Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

# Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
